# QuizWorld
This is a quiz application I made for a university where I live.

The teacher writes the questions and up to 4 possible answers. 
They're able compartmentalize the questions into different subject and subject topics.
Then they can assign different subjects to specific classes(of students).
Thereafter the students can be added then assigned to a specific class.

After the student is finished with the quiz the teacher can access analytics that cen determine the following:
- Easiest or hardest question to answer
- Subjects that classes or individual students are struggling to understand
- Specific topics within subjects that classes or individual students are struggling to understand
Such data han help the teacher asses the quality of understanding within specific subjects or topics with astonishing accuarcy 
and therefore remedy the problem before it's too late.
The analytics can be displayed very flexibly allowing easy and intuitive visualizations of results such as a specific class or group but also per individual student
and also the history up until that point.
There was also basic analysis for each of the individual students where the algorithm would automatically identify specific topics and/or question that would help
the student improve their overall performance.

There are 2 modes of quizes:
- Practice, 
  where the student will receive a feedback if they select the wrong answer.
- Test, 
  where no feedback will be displayed and also there will be a time limit per quiz.
  
  The application is made of mainly HTML5, css3, JS and SQL.
  I also used some JS libraries whenever the html5 standard didn't suid my need suh as: 
  jQuery(overall animation), lightbox(for photos), sortable and tabulator(for selecting and sorting classes and subjects).
  I also used bootstrap to help me standardalize my design, however I also took some inspiration from DLingo.
